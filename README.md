# RaspberyPi Sense Hat Experiments

## reset_matrix.py

Clear and re-orient the matrix display.

## gravity_ball.py

Roll the ball on the field by tilting the RPi. So much fun. The joystick gradually changes the color.

## pixel_control.py

Based on the example from the RPi SenseHat site. Move the pixel with
the joystick. With some added lines coming in from the corners. Woo hoo.
